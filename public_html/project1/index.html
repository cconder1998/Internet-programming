<h2 class="about_me">About Me</h2>
<p>
	I was born on the 23rd of March 1998, in 
	<a class="personal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whanganui" target="_blank">Wanganui, New Zealand</a>. 
	My parents are Rob and Paula Conder and I have two younger brothers, 
	Thomas and Ben. I love my family and I am proud of where I come from 
	because they have made me the best version of myself.
</p>
<p>
	I came to the University of North Florida to be a part of the Cross-Country 
	and Track & Field teams. Both of my parents are runners and running was 
	instilled in me at a young age. I've been fortunate enough to visit many parts 
	of the country and world through my running.
</p>
<h2 class="hobbies">Hobbies & Interests</h2>
<p>
	My favourite pass time is watching TV or movies. My favourite TV shows are 
	Dr Who and Game of Thrones. My favourite movies are the Harry Potter Series.
</p>
<p>
	I've started read novels a lot more recently. I like to read in bed and I've
	found that it helps me go to sleep easier. I'm currently reading Percy Jackson.

<p>
	I enjoy all kinds of sports, particulary beach sports. My friends and I often spend 
	the weekend at the beach playing football, frisbee, spikeball, or 
	<a class="personal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union" target="_blank">Rugby</a>. 
	Its always fun to play in the waves too.
</p>
<p>
	I'm also into music. I played violin a lot when I was younger and now I like to 
	play the ukelele when I'm bored.
</p>
<h2 class="education">Education</h2>
<p>
	My educational goal is to graduate from the University of North Florida in Spring 
	2021 with a Bachelor of Science degree, focusing on Information Science with a 
	minor in Leadership. <br />
	I am currently in my Junior year at the University of North Florida and I am 
	working hard towards this goal.
</p>

<p>
	At the age of 5, I attended Durie Hill Primary School for one year. My second 
	year of school was at Waverley Primary School. From years 3 to 8, I was a 
	student at St. George's Prepratory School. I attended 5 years of High School at 
	<a class="personal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whanganui_Collegiate_School" target="_blank">Wanganui Collegiate School</a>.
